# Haiku

#### Epicodus Intro to Programming

#### By Matt Smith and Ryan Murray

## Description

This app was built entirely using TDD, thus there's no front end.  The aim of this app is to determine the number of syllables in lines of a given poem and thus determine whether said poem falls under the classification of a haiku which is determined as containing 3 lines with syllable counts of 5/7/5.  Given the complexity of the English language and how much English borrows from other languages and thus doesn't follow a consistent set of pronunciation rules, this app accounts for the vast majority of words commonly used in English.

I'd like to return to this project sometime in the future and completely flesh it out.
